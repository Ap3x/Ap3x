### Hello, I'm Noah ðŸ‘‹
  
Im currently a Security Engineer at Netragard Inc. where I conduct pentest for large and small corporations in all different types of industry. At Netragard I also develop tools, payloads, and help maintain the offensive infrastructure used during pentest. I graduated from the University of Louisville where I double majored in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. During my free time I like to spend time sharpening my skills through hacking platforms, programming projects, CTFs, or working on my home lab. In my home lab I like to build upon my knowledge about virtualization, linux, networking, offensive/defensive security, and to play around with other tools and operating systems. I also love photography, hiking, camping, and traveling, exploring new places, learning about cultures, and cooking and trying new food.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on offensive payloads
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything ðŸ¤£
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other content creators
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love traveling and photography
